# RPNtool
Infix to RPN and back

This is a perl script to transform infix mathematical expressions into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

I created this perl script to help enter these expressions into my HP 28c RPN calculator (yes it is a museum piece but it got me through university :)  )

Requirements:

As a user I want the ability to:
  Specify infix mathematical expressions, and have a RPN sequence (postfix expression) returned.
  The following arthimetic operators shall be recognized:  + - * / ^ (exponent)
  The following mathematical functions shall be recognized:  sin cos tan log ln
